## 🧠 System Architecture Overview
The OptiMoldIQWorkflow implements a **conditional three-phase architecture** for maximum efficiency:

| Phase | Trigger Condition | Components | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|------------|---------|
| **🔄 Phase 1** | Always executes | `DataPipelineOrchestrator` | Data collection and change detection |
| **🏗️ Phase 2** | When data changes detected | `ValidationOrchestrator`<br>`OrderProgressTracker` | Shared DB building and validation |
| **📊 Phase 2.5** | When sufficient historical data | `MoldStabilityIndexCalculator`<br>`MoldMachineFeatureWeightCalculator` | Historical insights generation |
| **📋 Phase 3** | When purchase orders change | `ProducingProcessor`<br>`PendingProcessor` | Production planning and optimization |

## 🔄 Workflow Components

### 🔹 **OptiMoldIQWorkflow - Main Orchestrator**
**Central coordinator** managing the entire daily workflow execution:
- **Smart Change Detection**: Only processes updates when actual changes are detected
- **Resource Optimization**: Conditional phase execution prevents unnecessary resource consumption  
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks all agent activities and generates unified reports
- **Error Resilience**: Implements centralized error handling with detailed logging

### 🔹 **Configuration Management System**
**Centralized parameter control** through `WorkflowConfig`:

#### Core Configuration Categories:
- **📁 Path Management**: Database directories, shared resources, output locations
- **⚙️ Processing Parameters**: Efficiency targets (85%), loss thresholds (3%), insight triggers
- **🔧 Agent-Specific Settings**: Load thresholds, priority orders, stability parameters
- **📊 Analytics Configuration**: Bootstrap sampling, confidence levels, feature weights

#### Key Parameters:
```python
efficiency: float = 0.85                    # Manufacturing efficiency target
historical_insight_threshold: int = 30      # Records needed for insights
max_load_threshold: int = 30                # Maximum processing load
cavity_stability_threshold: float = 0.6     # Cavity stability analysis
confidence_level: float = 0.95              # Statistical confidence
```

---

### 🔹 **Intelligent Change Detection Engine**
**Dynamic workflow optimization** through smart change detection:

#### Detection Mechanisms:
- **Data Update Monitoring**: Tracks changes in `productRecords`, `purchaseOrders`
- **Historical Threshold Analysis**: Triggers insights when `recordDate count % 30 == 0`
- **Conditional Processing**: Only executes downstream agents when changes detected
- **Resource Conservation**: Prevents unnecessary processing cycles

#### Decision Logic:
```python
trigger = data_changes_detected           # Phase 2 execution flag
historical_request = sufficient_records   # Phase 2.5 execution flag  
po_changes = purchase_order_updates       # Phase 3 execution flag
```

---

### 🔹 **Historical Insights Generation (Phase 2.5)**
**Advanced analytics** when sufficient historical data is available:

#### 📊 MoldStabilityIndexCalculator
- **Cavity Stability Analysis**: Evaluates production consistency across mold cavities
- **Cycle Time Stability**: Monitors cycle time variations for predictable performance
- **Statistical Thresholds**: Applies configurable thresholds for reliability assessment
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies stability patterns over time periods

#### 🎯 MoldMachineFeatureWeightCalculator  
- **Bootstrap Statistical Analysis**: 500-sample bootstrap for confidence intervals
- **Feature Importance Scoring**: Calculates weights for mold-machine combinations
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Targets NGRate minimization, capacity maximization
- **Confidence-Weighted Results**: Integrates statistical confidence in recommendations

---

### 🔹 **Production Planning Agents (Phase 3)**
**Optimized production scheduling** through specialized processors:

#### 🏭 ProducingProcessor
- **Production Data Analysis**: Processes current manufacturing operations
- **Efficiency Calculations**: Applies configured efficiency and loss parameters
- **Progress Integration**: Uses stability indices and machine weights for optimization
- **Performance Reporting**: Generates detailed production analysis reports

#### 📋 PendingProcessor
- **Order Optimization**: Priority-based processing using `PriorityOrder.PRIORITY_1`
- **Load Balancing**: Respects maximum load thresholds for sustainable operations  
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes machine-mold assignments based on historical data
- **Schedule Generation**: Creates feasible production schedules

---

## 🛠️ Smart Processing Mechanisms

### 🔹 **Conditional Execution Engine**
**Resource-efficient processing** through intelligent phase management:

#### Smart Triggers:
- **Phase 2**: `if data_changes_detected` → ValidationOrchestrator + OrderProgressTracker
- **Phase 2.5**: `if historical_insight_request` → Stability + Weight Calculators  
- **Phase 3**: `if 'purchaseOrders' in updated_details` → Production Processors

#### Benefits:
- **Performance Optimization**: Eliminates unnecessary processing cycles
- **Resource Conservation**: Reduces computational overhead during stable periods
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles varying workload demands efficiently
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes infrastructure resource consumption

---

### 🔸 **Centralized Error Handling**
**Robust fault tolerance** through the `_safe_execute` mechanism:

#### Error Management Features:
- **Operation Isolation**: Each agent execution wrapped in try-catch blocks
- **Contextual Logging**: Detailed error information with operation names
- **Error Chain Preservation**: Maintains original error context with `from e`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Workflow continues where possible despite individual failures

#### Recovery Strategy:
```python
try:
    result = operation_func(*args, **kwargs)
    logger.info(f"{operation_name} completed successfully")
    return result
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in {operation_name}: {e}")
    raise WorkflowError(f"Failed to execute {operation_name}: {e}") from e
```

## 📊 Comprehensive Reporting System

### 🔹 **Multi-Level Report Generation**
**Detailed operational visibility** through structured reporting:

#### Report Categories:
- **📈 Data Collection Reports**: Pipeline execution summaries, change detection results
- **✅ Validation Reports**: Data quality assessments, consistency checks  
- **📊 Progress Reports**: Order tracking, production status updates
- **🎯 Planning Reports**: Optimization results, scheduling recommendations
- **📋 Historical Insights**: Stability analysis, feature weight calculations

#### Report Features:
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Full Vietnamese language support
- **Timestamped Versioning**: Automatic file naming with execution timestamps  
- **Historical Archival**: Automatic backup of previous reports
- **Audit Trail**: Complete change log tracking with detailed operation history

---

### 🔸 **Output Path Collection**
**Centralized result tracking** for downstream integration:

#### Generated Outputs:
- `data_pipeline_orchestrator_path`: Main pipeline execution results
- `order_progress_path`: Production tracking updates  
- `producing_plan_path`: Current production schedules
- `pending_initial_plan_path`: Optimized pending order plans
- `mold_stability_index_path`: Historical stability analysis (conditional)
- `mold_machine_weights_hist_path`: Feature weight calculations (conditional)

#### Integration Benefits:

- **Conditional Outputs**: Only generates paths for executed components
- **Version Control**: Automatic path updates with latest execution results
- **Monitoring Support**: Enables external systems to track workflow progress
