## 📝 Business Problem 

### Background
In plastic molding production, achieving optimal efficiency while maintaining high product quality is challenging due to the complexity of interconnected factors like:
- Mold utilization and machine maintenance.
- Resin inventory management.
- Production scheduling and yield optimization.

### Challenges 
Poor management or lack of integration between components can lead to:
- Increased production downtime.
- Material waste or stock shortages.
- Unbalanced machine and mold utilization.
- Inconsistent product quality or high NG (non-good) rates.
- Reduced production yield and efficiency.

### Problem Statement
Current systems are:
- Manual or static, lacking real-time insights.
- Prone to inefficiencies in scheduling, resource tracking, and quality management.
