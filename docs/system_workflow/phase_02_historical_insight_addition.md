# Historical Insight Addition Phase

## Overview

The *Historical Insight Addition Phase* is the second stage of the **OptiMoldIQ** system, responsible for processing historical production data into actionable insights and populating a shared database for optimal production planning. The workflow consists of two specialized agents executed sequentially:

```
Shared Database â†’ HistoryProcessor â†’ FeatureWeightCalculator â†’ Insight Repository
```

## Implementation Code

### HistoryProcessor Setup
```python
from agents.autoPlanner.initialPlanner.history_processor import HistoryProcessor

history_processor = HistoryProcessor(
    source_path = f"{shared_db_dir}/DataLoaderAgent/newest",
    annotation_name = 'path_annotations.json',
    databaseSchemas_path = f"{mock_db_dir}/databaseSchemas.json",
    folder_path = f"{shared_db_dir}/OrderProgressTracker",
    target_name = "change_log.txt",
    default_dir = shared_db_dir,
    efficiency = 0.85,
    loss = 0.03,
)

# Calculate mold stability index
history_processor.calculate_and_save_mold_stability_index(
    cavity_stability_threshold = 0.6,
    cycle_stability_threshold = 0.4,
    total_records_threshold = 30
)
```

### FeatureWeightCalculator Setup
```python
from agents.autoPlanner.feature_weight_calculator import FeatureWeightCalculator

# Load mold stability index
mold_stability_index_folder = f"{shared_db_dir}/HistoryProcessor/mold_stability_index"
mold_stability_index_target_name = "change_log.txt"

# Calculate and save feature weights for mold-machine priority matrix
FeatureWeightCalculator(
    source_path = f"{shared_db_dir}/DataLoaderAgent/newest",
    annotation_name = 'path_annotations.json',
    databaseSchemas_path = f"{mock_db_dir}/databaseSchemas.json",
    folder_path = f"{shared_db_dir}/OrderProgressTracker",
    target_name = "change_log.txt",
    default_dir = shared_db_dir,
    efficiency = 0.85,
    loss = 0.03,
    scaling = 'absolute',
    confidence_weight = 0.3,
    n_bootstrap = 500,
    confidence_level = 0.95,
    min_sample_size = 10,
    feature_weights = None,
    targets = {'shiftNGRate': 'minimize',
                'shiftCavityRate': 1.0,
                'shiftCycleTimeRate': 1.0,
                'shiftCapacityRate': 1.0}
).calculate_and_save_report(mold_stability_index_folder,
                            mold_stability_index_target_name)
```

## Trigger Mechanism

### Trigger Logic

The Historical Insight Addition Phase is triggered **monthly** with automatic execution:

```python
# Monthly automated execution
def monthly_insight_generation():
    # 1. Run HistoryProcessor
    history_processor.calculate_and_save_mold_stability_index(
        cavity_stability_threshold = 0.6,
        cycle_stability_threshold = 0.4,
        total_records_threshold = 30
    )
    
    # 2. Run FeatureWeightCalculator
    feature_calculator = FeatureWeightCalculator(...)
    feature_calculator.calculate_and_save_report(
        mold_stability_index_folder,
        mold_stability_index_target_name
    )
    
    return "Historical insights generated and saved to shared database"

# Automated scheduling
schedule.every().month.do(monthly_insight_generation)
```

### Execution Flow
1. **HistoryProcessor** analyzes historical data and generates mold stability insights
2. **FeatureWeightCalculator** processes the stability data and computes feature weights
3. **Auto-Save Functionality**: All reports automatically saved to shared database
4. **Shared Database Population**: Insights become available for downstream planning phases

This automated approach ensures consistent insight generation without manual intervention.
