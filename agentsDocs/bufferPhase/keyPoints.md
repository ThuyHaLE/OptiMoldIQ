# Buffer Phase: Transition from Rule-Based to AI/RL

The **buffer phase** focuses on refining the rule-based system and preparing for future AI or RL implementation. Below are the key points to guide the process.

## 1. Finalize Rule-Based System:
- Ensure all agents have clear, well-defined rules.
- Validate agent performance by checking the consistency and accuracy of outputs.
- Continuously gather feedback to improve future iterations of the rule-based system.

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing:
- Ensure all relevant data (e.g., production history, yield, resin usage) is captured and stored.
- Structure data for easy future utilization by AI/RL agents.
- Ensure historical data consistency and completeness for future RL training.

## 3. Feedback Loops:
- Establish mechanisms for administrators to refine the rules based on feedback.
- Track human decisions as ground truth for future learning (AI/RL).
- Gather data on admin decisions to provide valuable insights during the transition.

## 4. Build Dashboards & Reports:
- Design dashboards to visualize agent outputs and key metrics (e.g., NG rates, yield optimization).
- Prepare reports for long-term monitoring and refinement of production processes.

## 5. Define Potential AI/RL Use Cases:
- Plan areas where AI/RL will enhance decision-making, such as optimizing cycle times or resin usage.
- Identify specific tasks where AI/RL can add the most value in the future.

## 6. Modular System Design:
- Build the rule-based system with modularity and adaptability in mind for future AI integration.
- Prepare for an easy transition by allowing parallel use of AI models and rule-based agents.

## 7. Testing and Validation:
- Test rule-based agents in various scenarios to verify their outputs align with expected outcomes.
- Establish a validation framework for the future AI phase to ensure smooth transition and measurable performance.

## 8. Human Involvement Strategy:
- Define the role of human decision-makers during the buffer phase and after AI transition.
- Collect human feedback regularly to improve both the rule-based system and future AI models.

## 9. Prepare for Transition:
- Identify areas where rules can be relaxed for data-driven decision-making.
- Develop a roadmap for transitioning agents to AI capabilities (data flow, agent responsibilities, etc.).

## 10. Communication and Monitoring:
- Keep stakeholders (admins, operators) informed about the transition plan and roadmap.
- Monitor rule-based system performance to ensure the transition is on track and effective.

## 11. Documentation:
- Document the logic of the rule-based agents for future reference during AI integration.
- Ensure documentation covers processes, challenges, and key decisions made during development.

## 12. Risk Management:
- Identify potential risks during the transition to AI and create a contingency plan.
- Establish a process for handling issues that arise during the transition to AI without disrupting operations.
