# Enhanced Resin Coordinate Agent Plan with Automated Runner Recycling

## 1. **Automated Runner Recycling Workflow**
Incorporating granulators or shredders will automate the process of recycling runners. This will allow us to recycle resin that would otherwise be discarded, reducing resin consumption and increasing sustainability.

### **Inputs:**
- **Historical Runner Data**: Information on runner quantities and characteristics from past production runs.
- **Resin Usage Data**: Historical data on resin consumption (both new and recycled).
- **Granulator/Shredder Capacity**: Data on how much resin can be recycled in a given time period (processing rate).
- **ItemType and Mold Data**: Information on which products are more or less suited to efficient runner recycling.

### **Process:**
- **Automated Runner Processing**: After molding is complete, runners (unused plastic) will be sent to **granulators** or **shredders** for automated recycling.
- **Tracking Runner Recycling Rates**: Monitor how much resin is being processed from runners to be reused. This data should be updated in real-time or periodically.
- **Predict Resin Reuse**: Predict the proportion of recycled resin based on the quantity of runners processed. This will vary depending on resin type and item produced.
- **Update Resin Flow**: Recycled runner resin will contribute to the total resin used for production, adjusting the total resin consumption forecast accordingly.

### **Automated Runner Recycling Workflow Report:**

| Field Name          | Type        | Description                                    |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| shift               | Integer     | Shift number                                   |
| itemCode            | String      | Item code for which the runner is processed    |
| runnerQty           | Float       | Quantity of runners produced                   |
| recycledQty         | Float       | Quantity of resin recycled from runners        |
| recyclingRate       | Float       | Rate of recycling (based on granulator/shredder efficiency) |
| resinType           | String      | Type of resin used (recycled or new)           |
| forecastedQty       | Float       | Forecasted resin requirement (adjusted with recycled resin) |

## 2. **Predictive Runner Reuse Models**
We can use **historical production data** to build predictive models for **optimal runner reuse** based on various factors such as resin type, item type, and mold characteristics.

### **Inputs:**
- **Historical Runner Data**: Data on previous production runs, including the amount of runner produced and the resin's ability to be recycled.
- **Item Type & Resin Type**: Certain items and resins may be more or less compatible with reuse, so these variables should be considered.
- **Mold Configuration**: Some molds may produce more usable runners than others, influencing the reuse rate.

### **Process:**
- **Predict Optimal Reuse Ratios**: Use machine learning or statistical modeling to predict the **optimal ratio of new vs. recycled resin** for different production scenarios.
  - E.g., for **item A**, use **70% new resin** and **30% recycled resin**, while for **item B**, use **50% recycled resin**.
- **Dynamic Adjustment of Reuse Rates**: As more data is collected, continually adjust the predictive models for **reuse ratios**. This could be based on real-time data about the **quality of recycled resin**.

### **Output for Predictive Reuse Model:**

| Field Name           | Type        | Description                                             |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| itemCode             | String      | Item code for which the reuse ratio is predicted         |
| resinType            | String      | Type of resin used in the production (new vs. recycled)  |
| optimalReuseRatio    | Float       | Predicted optimal ratio of recycled to new resin         |
| confidenceLevel      | Float       | Confidence in the predicted reuse ratio                  |
| productionStatus     | String      | Status of the reuse prediction (e.g., "validated" or "new") |

## 3. **Integration with Yield Optimization Agent**
To further enhance production efficiency, we will share **runner reuse data** with the **Yield Optimization Agent**. This will ensure that the **reuse of runners** doesn't compromise **product quality**, and it will optimize overall production efficiency by balancing yield and resin costs.

### **Inputs:**
- **Recycled Resin Data**: Real-time or periodic data on the amount of recycled resin being used, including the ratio of recycled resin in the molding process.
- **Quality Control Data**: Information on how the recycled resin affects product quality, such as defects or NG (non-good) rates.

### **Process:**
- **Data Sharing**: Automatically send the runner reuse data to the **Yield Optimization Agent** for integration.
- **Feedback Loop**: The Yield Optimization Agent will use this data to assess whether increasing the amount of recycled resin affects the **NG rate** or overall **production yield**.
- **Adjust Resin Usage**: If the reuse of runners leads to higher defects, the agent will adjust the amount of recycled resin used for future production runs.

### **Resin Optimization Report (Integrated with Yield Optimization Agent):**

| Field Name         | Type        | Description                                    |

| newResinQty        | Float       | Amount of new resin used                      |
| NGRate             | Float       | Non-good rate associated with the recycled resin use |
| yield              | Float       | Production yield based on resin mix            |
