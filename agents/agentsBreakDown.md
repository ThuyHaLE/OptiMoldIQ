## OptiMoldIQ

### Production Monitoring Agent
- Role: Track and monitor production in real time.
- Responsibilities: Collect data on cycle times, shot counts, yield rates, and production statuses. Provide insights into production efficiency and identify areas for improvement.

### Machine Management Agent
- Role: Oversee machine health and performance.
- Responsibilities: Monitor machine utilization, maintenance schedules, downtime, and performance. Trigger alerts for maintenance when thresholds (e.g., shot count, NG rate) are met.

### Material Management Agent
- Role: Manage materials used in production.
- Responsibilities: Track material inventory levels, usage, and replenishment. Optimize material allocation to ensure cost efficiency and reduce waste.

### NG Analysis Agent
- Role: Analyze non-good product (NG) rates and optimize production.
- Responsibilities: Assess the causes of NG products, like defects, short shots, or other issues. Adjust cycle time or suggest process changes to reduce NG rates.

### Mold Schedule Agent
- Role: Handle mold maintenance and scheduling.
- Responsibilities: Track mold usage and maintenance needs based on mold performance and NG rates. Schedule mold maintenance or replacements based on these metrics.

### Inventory Optimization Agent
- Role: Optimize storage and inventory management.
- Responsibilities: Improve the layout of materials in storage, track inventory, and suggest reordering actions to minimize stockouts or overstock.

### Scheduling and Planning Agent
- Role: Plan production schedules based on demand, availability, and capacity.
- Responsibilities: Align production orders with machine availability, mold schedules, and raw material inventory. Optimize production efficiency and minimize lead time.

### Inventory Agent
- Role: Monitor raw materials and finished product inventory.
- Responsibilities: Track stock levels in real time, forecast material needs, and trigger reordering or stock alerts. Ensure that the production line has the necessary materials available.

### Energy Efficiency Agent (Optional)
- Role: Monitor and optimize energy usage in the molding process.
- Responsibilities: Track energy consumption across machines and production lines. Suggest changes in processes or settings to reduce energy consumption while maintaining product quality.
