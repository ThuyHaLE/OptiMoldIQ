# **ChangeTracking Agent**  

## **Role**  
- Tracks and logs all **modifications** to production records.  
- Ensures **changes are approved** before updating the main database.  
- Provides a **modification approval mechanism** for admins.  
- **Healing Mechanism**: Flags invalid changes, prevents incorrect updates, and suggests corrections.

## **Inputs**  
- **productionStatus.xlsx** (Real-time production records)  
- **permissionControl.xlsx** (User permission settings)  
- **static database (moldInfo.xlsx, machineInfo.xlsx, etc.)** (Reference for validation)  
- **adminApprovals** (Manual approvals from authorized users)

## **Process Flow**  

1. **Monitor production record changes** after each working shift.  
2. **Compare modified records** against existing production data.  
3. **Validate changes** based on:  
   - **Permission levels** (Ensures only authorized users can modify records).  
   - **Static database checks** (Cross-checks input with mold, machine, resin data, etc.).  
4. **Apply healing mechanism**:  
   - **Auto-correct minor errors** (e.g., wrong date format, missing spaces).  
   - **Flag invalid entries** (e.g., an unlisted machine number).  
   - **Suggest corrections** based on historical data or reference files.  
5. **Request admin approval for flagged changes** before updating records.  
6. **Generate reports** for change logs and approvals.  
7. **Update the production records** only after approval.
