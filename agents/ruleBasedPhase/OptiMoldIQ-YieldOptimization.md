# **YieldOptimization Agent**

## **Role:**
Optimizes yield and resin allocation to improve production efficiency.

## **Input:**
- **productRecord**: A detailed record of the current product being produced (including quantity, cycle time, and resin used).
- **historical yield data**: Past production data, including yield rates, NG (non-good) rates, and resin consumption to identify patterns for optimization.

## **Process:**
1. **Monitor Actual Yield**: 
   - Continuously track the actual yield versus the predicted default yield.
   - Use the historical yield data to assess if current cycle times and resin allocations are efficient.
   
2. **Evaluate Impact of Cycle Time Changes on Yield and NG Rates**: 
   - Analyze the effects of different cycle times on yield quality and NG rates.
   - Adjust cycle time as needed based on historical data and optimization goals.

3. **Evaluate Resin Quantity Usage**:
   - Analyze resin consumption data (both new resin and recycled resin) to determine the most efficient resin quantity for production.
   - Optimize resin usage while considering recycling rates of runner resin (30% reuse and 70% new).

4. **Suggest Optimized Cycle Times and Resin Quantities**:
   - Based on the yield analysis, suggest optimal cycle times and resin quantities that balance yield and efficiency.
   - Take into account the limitations on resin storage and available space for material handling.

5. **Optimization Decision Support for Admin**:
   - Present suggestions to the admin based on the optimization calculations.
   - The admin can decide whether to accept the changes or refine the setup further.

## **Output:**
A detailed report with optimization suggestions, yield impacts, and historical data for admin review and decision-making.
