# Business Problem for OptiMoldIQ System
---

## Background:
In plastic molding production, achieving optimal efficiency while maintaining high product quality is a challenging task. The process involves multiple interconnected factors such as mold utilization, machine maintenance, resin inventory, production scheduling, and yield optimization. Poor management or lack of integration between these components can result in:

- Increased production downtime.
- Excessive material waste or stock shortages.
- Unbalanced machine and mold utilization, leading to higher maintenance costs.
- Inconsistent product quality or unacceptable non-good (NG) rates.
- Reduced overall production yield and efficiency.

## Problem Statement:
Currently, production monitoring, resource tracking, and scheduling processes are largely manual, siloed, or dependent on static systems that lack real-time insights. This leads to inefficiencies, including:

- ***Ineffective Production Scheduling***: <Br>Without considering real-time machine, mold, and resin availability, schedules are prone to delays and require frequent manual adjustments.
- ***Material and Resource Waste***: <Br>Resin quantities are often miscalculated, leading to overstocking or shortages. Maintenance schedules for molds and machines are reactive rather than predictive.
- ***Yield and Quality Challenges***: <Br>Lack of actionable insights into quality control and yield optimization results in inconsistent product quality and suboptimal cycle times.
- ***Inefficient Decision-Making***: <Br>Key production data is scattered across various sources, making it difficult for managers to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Goals:

- ***Integrated Planning and Monitoring***: <Br>Develop a unified system that automates production scheduling, tracking of resin, mold, and machine usage, and optimizes resource utilization.
- ***Quality and Yield Insights***: <Br>Provide actionable insights for improving product quality and optimizing production yield by balancing cycle times and NG rates.
- ***Proactive Maintenance and Restocking***: <Br>Implement predictive maintenance and resin restocking schedules to prevent unplanned downtime and material shortages.
- ***Visualization and Decision Support***: <Br>Build a centralized dashboard to visualize daily production, resource utilization, and long-term performance trends for better decision-making.

## Solution Overview:
The OptiMoldIQ System leverages a multi-agent architecture to address these challenges. Each agent performs specific tasks, including production status monitoring, initial and final scheduling, resource tracking, maintenance scheduling, and quality control. These agents work together seamlessly using shared databases to optimize efficiency, reduce waste, and ensure continuous production.
