# Detailed Task List for OptiMoldIQ Master Development Plan

## **Foundational Stage (Rule-Based System)**

### **Database Setup**

- [ ] **Task:** Set up the Static Database (Machine, Resin, Mold, etc.)
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 1 week
  - **Details:** Create tables for all static resources that are essential for the production process. These should include machine details, resin types, mold configurations, and other static parameters that don't change frequently. Ensure that access control is set to read-only for agents.

- [ ] **Task:** Set up the Dynamic Database (Production Records, PO list, etc.)
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 2 weeks
  - **Details:** Set up a dynamic database to handle frequently updated production data. This includes records such as daily production logs, resin consumption, and real-time machine performance. This database should be updated in real time and should allow production staff to update it, while agents can only access it in read-only mode.

- [ ] **Task:** Set up Main Data Database (Aggregated Results and Planning Data)
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 1 week
  - **Details:** Set up a main data structure that stores processed and aggregated data such as scheduling results, production summaries, and agent feedback. This database will be used for higher-level decision-making and will not be modified directly by agents.

- [ ] **Task:** Set up Shared Database (Central Hub for Agent Data Exchange)
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 2 weeks
  - **Details:** Set up a shared database that stores data from all agents. This includes outputs such as reports, performance data, and feedback loops between agents. Ensure the database is structured for fast data exchange and supports cross-agent communication.

- [ ] **Task:** Set up Historical Database (Past Production Data, PO list, Resin Usage, etc.)
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 2 weeks
  - **Details:** Set up a historical database that stores long-term production data, resin usage patterns, maintenance schedules, and other key metrics. This data will be used for trend analysis, yield optimization, and reinforcement learning algorithms.

### **DashboardBuilderAgent (Data Visualization)**

- [ ] **Task:** Design the Dashboard Builder Agent (Data Visualization)
  - **Type:** Design
  - **Lead Time:** 2 weeks
  - **Details:** Design the user interface and data visualization layouts. Decide what metrics and KPIs will be displayed (e.g., cycle time, NG rate, yield, resin usage patterns). Determine which types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) will best represent the data for users.

---

### **Historical Report for Resin Optimization and Yield Analysis**

- [ ] **Task:** Generate historical reports on the relationship between cycle time, NG rate, and yield
  - **Type:** Design/Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 4 weeks
  - **Details:** Collect historical data from the production records. Analyze the relationships between cycle time, NG rate, and yield, identifying any patterns or correlations. Design the report format and integrate it into the DashboardBuilderAgent for visualization.

- [ ] **Task:** Analyze and visualize resin usage patterns to optimize resin quantity
  - **Type:** Design/Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 4 weeks
  - **Details:** Analyze historical resin usage data, focusing on how usage varies across different production conditions (e.g., small batches, re-molding, continuous production). Create visualizations that display resin usage trends and help determine how to optimize resin allocation based on production needs.

## **Upgrade Stage (RL & Cloud-Based System)**

### **1. Historical Data Integration for RL**

- [ ] **Task:** Incorporate historical data for reinforcement learning
  - **Type:** Knowledge/Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 3 weeks
  - **Details:** Gather and clean historical data (production records, resin usage, maintenance schedules). Prepare this data for use in reinforcement learning algorithms. This may involve feature engineering to represent the data in a way that an RL agent can learn from.

---

### **2. Cloud Database Setup**

- [ ] **Task:** Migrate the shared database to the cloud
  - **Type:** Implementation
  - **Lead Time:** 3 weeks
  - **Details:** Migrate the Excel-based shared database to a cloud-based platform (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure). This will allow for better scalability and accessibility for all agents in the system. Ensure the cloud database is optimized for handling large datasets and real-time updates.
