# **OptiMoldIQ Development Plan**

## **Phase 1: System Design & Basic Development (Agent-based System)**
**Objective:** Build core agents, connect with the static database (Excel), generate initial production plans, and develop related agents (Resin, Mold, Machine, etc.).  
**Estimated Duration:** 6-8 weeks (including testing and adjustments)  

### **Tasks:**
1. **System Design & Agent Requirement Definition (1-2 weeks)**
   - Define detailed specifications for each agent.
   - Design workflows and communication between agents.
   - Ensure scalability in the system design.

2. **Develop Core Agents (2-3 weeks)**
   - Develop:
     - **AutoStatus Agent**
     - **InitialSched Agent**
     - **FinalSched Agent**
     - **ResinRestock Agent**
     - **MaintenanceScheduler Agent**
     - **DashBoardBuilderAgent**
   - Test interactions between agents using data from the static database (Excel).

3. **Build Data Update Processes (1-2 weeks)**
   - Configure the system to work with current Excel data.
   - Ensure agents can accurately retrieve and output data.

4. **Testing & Optimization of the Basic System (1 week)**
   - Validate system performance and adjust agents accordingly.
   - Ensure smooth operation from data input, processing, to output.

## **Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Integration**
**Objective:** Integrate Reinforcement Learning using historical data and user feedback to optimize the system and production decisions.  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 weeks  

### **Tasks:**
1. **Historical Data Analysis & Preparation (1-2 weeks)**
   - Assess data quality (even if past performance was suboptimal, data is still useful for learning).
   - Preprocess and prepare data for RL training.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Integration (2-3 weeks)**
   - Develop RL models to optimize decisions for:
     - Machine usage
     - Mold scheduling
     - Resin management
     - Maintenance planning
   - Integrate RL models into agents for learning from historical data and user feedback.

3. **Evaluate RL Effectiveness (1 week)**
   - Compare RL-based results with the initial rule-based system.
   - Adjust models to improve prediction accuracy.

## **Phase 3: System Stability & Self-Healing (Healing System)**
**Objective:** Ensure the system can recover automatically from failures or errors.  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks  

### **Tasks:**
1. **Design & Develop the Healing System (2 weeks)**
   - Implement self-healing mechanisms for agents and the system.
   - Develop monitoring tools to track system status and automatically adjust resources when issues arise.

2. **Testing & Deployment of the Healing System (1-2 weeks)**
   - Ensure the system can recover automatically from failures.
   - Test system stability under real failure scenarios.

## **Phase 4: Security, Monitoring, and Scalability Optimization**
**Objective:** Enhance security, monitor system performance, and prepare for future scalability.  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 weeks  

### **Tasks:**
1. **Security & Monitoring (2-3 weeks)**
   - Implement security measures for data systems, including access control and encryption.
   - Set up monitoring tools (**Prometheus, Grafana**) to track system performance and status.

2. **Alerting & Logging Setup (1 week)**
   - Configure an alert system to notify administrators of failures or unusual changes.

3. **Performance Optimization (1-2 weeks)**
   - Improve system performance through **caching and load balancing**.

---

## **Phase 5: Expansion with Microservices (System Upgrade)**
**Objective:** Prepare for microservices expansion when needed as the system grows in complexity.  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks (planned for the future)  

### **Tasks:**
1. **Convert Agents into Microservices (2 weeks)**
   - Separate agents into independent microservices.
   - Configure an **API Gateway** to manage communication between microservices.

2. **Database & Data Adapter Layer Preparation (1-2 weeks)**
   - Design and implement a **Data Adapter Layer** to transition from Excel to a scalable database (SQL or NoSQL).
   - Update services to support the new database infrastructure.
