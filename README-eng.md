## Business Problem Statement

### 1. Current Challenges
#### a. Production Monitoring Inefficiencies
- Difficulty in tracking real-time production status across multiple machines.
- Lack of insight into the relationship between cycle time and NG rate (non-good products).
- Inefficient handling of production records leading to manual errors.
#### b. Machine Management
- Suboptimal machine utilization and scheduling.
- Insufficient tracking of maintenance schedules, leading to downtime or lower efficiency.
#### c. Material Management
- Challenges in managing plastic resin, color masterbatch, and additive inventory.
- Inefficient storage leading to delays in production due to misplaced or insufficient materials.
#### d. Mold Maintenance
- High NG rates due to worn-out molds.
- Lack of real-time tracking for mold shot counts and maintenance thresholds.
#### e. Data Integration and Scalability
- Static data from Excel files lacks real-time updates.
- Inability to integrate data from IoT sensors and other dynamic sources seamlessly.
#### f. Planning and Scheduling
- Difficulty in aligning production plans with resource availability.
- Suboptimal scheduling leads to delays and underperformance.

### 2. Business Goals
#### a. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts
- Provide real-time updates and notifications for production status.
- Predict NG risks and optimize cycle time dynamically.
#### b. Efficient Resource Management
- Optimize machine usage and mold scheduling.
- Streamline material storage and handling within the defined area.
#### c. Improved Maintenance Tracking
